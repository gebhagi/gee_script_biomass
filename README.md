# GEE Script for Biomass Estimation

This repository contains Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts designed for downloading, pre-processing, processing, and deriving vegetation indices using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 imagery. 
## Contents

- **Forest Biomass_L8**: Scripts for downloading and processing Landsat-8 data.
- **Forest Biomass_S2**: Scripts for downloading and processing Sentinel-2 data.

## Features

- **Data Acquisition**: Automated downloading of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery for Chure region for the time frame 2017 to 2019.
- **Pre-processing**: Includes cloud masking, atmospheric correction, and other necessary preprocessing steps to prepare the imagery for analysis.
- **Vegetation Indices Calculation**: Derivation of various vegetation indices such as NDVI, EVI, etc., which are required for biomass estimation.
- - **Statistical Analysis**: Statistical Analysis is done in SPSS software using the indices information obtained from analysis in GEE. 
- **Biomass Estimation**: Application of models to estimate forest biomass based on processed imagery and derived indices.

## Requirements

- A Google Earth Engine account. Sign up [here](https://earthengine.google.com/).
- Familiarity with JavaScript for executing and modifying the scripts in the GEE Code Editor.
